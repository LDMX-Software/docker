Docker build context for developing and running ldmx-sw: [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ldmx/dev)

There is a corresponding workflow in [ldmx-sw](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw) that generates a [production docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/ldmx/pro) using the container generated by this build context as a base image.
This production container already has ldmx-sw built and installed on it and assumes the user wants to run the application.

### Use in ldmx-sw

In _ldmx-sw_, an [environment script](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw/blob/master/scripts/ldmx-env.sh) is defined in `bash` to setup the environment for both `docker` and `singularity` correctly.
A description of this setup process is given for both [docker](docs/use_with_docker.md) and [singularity](docs/use_with_singularity.md) if you desire more information.
